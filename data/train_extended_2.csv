Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts.

This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong.

Can you even imagine what that father must have been feeling knowing that his little boy fell in this well while helping him and he could not get down there to help him! I just imagine how heartbreaking this whole situation must have been for the family and for the rescuers who spent days trying everything they could to get to him and potentially help him.
